# Crucible's Current roadmap
## High priority
- [ ] Rework the entire build system, installer jar paperclip style and pray the mojang gods does not go after us
- [ ] New release type, Crucible Reflux (Thermos with important security and bug fixes, drop in replacement for Thermos)
- [ ] Crucible wiki and general modding wiki
- [ ] Simple welcome website
- [ ] Drop the current dev branch, rework the way the stable-dev lifecycle is done

## Medium priority
- [ ] Possibly reattach/rewrite our current git history and make the repo a fork of thermos
- [ ] Guidelines for contribution, make new contributions easy for anyone
- [ ] Finish working the discord server
- [ ] Proper FAQ

## Low priority
- [ ] Mod fixes
- [ ] Automatic unit testing for crucible
- [ ] Bring back Crucible Time Machine and other projects to backport cool features
- [ ] Crucible API and implement a bukkit-forge bridge, bukkit plugins provided by mods
